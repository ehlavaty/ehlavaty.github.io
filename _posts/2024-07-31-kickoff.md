This project started as part of an [Introduction to DevSecOps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-devsecops/) 
class on [Coursera](https://about.coursera.org/).

Below are some references I used to build the site.

- [Github Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
- [Ruby Gem: github-pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem)

Also, as a longtime [vim](https://www.vim.org/) user, I forced myself to do all the work for this site using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which I have dabbled with off and on, but never committed to.
